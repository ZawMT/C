//Just trying gcc in macbook

//How to compile this
//gcc -o hello hello.c
//This command will generate a file hello

//How to run the result => ./hello
//If there is any permission issue, we can make the file runnable by this command => chmod a+x hello

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Hello");
	return 0;
}
